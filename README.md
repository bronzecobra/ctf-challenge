A tech startup called HyperNovatech has recently laid off one of their employees - Jacob Whitman. However they have reason to suspect that he has secretly opened a backdoor into their system and is accessing company data. They have hired you, a world-renowned cyber security specialist to find out how Jacob is retrieving this information so that they can sue him for millions and ruin his life (again).

# Task 1
Find Jacob's LinkedIn, maybe there will be some more information there...

# Task 2
The company suspects that Jacob has been hiding some information in an open source repo that he contributes to. 

# Task 3
The HyperNovatech lunch room gossip is that Jacob had access to the government nuclear launch codes, however he no longer has access to them since he got laid off and they were on the company system. Retrieve the nuclear launch codes.
